The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with multiple units.  For instance, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50% - 10px + 2em);` might cause unexpected results in different browsers or unexpected layout issues depending on the context. This is because the order of operations within the `calc()` function isn't always consistent across all browsers.
